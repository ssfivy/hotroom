#hotroom - Web accessible temperature measurement of my room.

It is summer.
Australia is hot.
I live in Australia.
My room is hot.

I usually escapes to library when it's too hot.
I want to know if my room is cool enough for me to come home.
So I make this script to send my room temperature to the internet.
